# YDSA Standing Committee Bylaws Amendment

## WHEREAS, YDSA and youth in general do not have a substantial presence in Austin DSA,

**WHEREAS**, the Austin DSA YDSA Coordinator has historically not been able to fulfill the duties outlined in the bylaws on their own,

**WHEREAS**, YDSA chapters are seen as autonomous organizations established independently, and not well supported or encouraged by Austin DSA,

**WHEREAS**, YDSA could be a key tool for working class mobilization and is critical to both the current and future socialist movement, 

**WHEREAS**, the lack of a well structured YDSA Chapter at the University of Texas at Austin and other schools in the area this academic year has hampered Austin DSA's ability to engage with the movement for Palestinian Liberation on campuses,

**WHEREAS**, the repression on the student movement is support of Palestinian liberation will continue to make a future socialist movement difficult without a well-structured chapter to further support the enhancement of student unity and coalition with Palestinian organizations on the UT Austin and other school campuses in the Austin area;

## THEREFORE IT BE RESOLVED, that we establish bylaws Article 7.2.8, "YDSA Committee," which shall read: 

The YDSA Committee shall have at least two members, and shall be responsible for forming and maintaining lasting connections with existing YDSA chapters across the Austin DSA area and encouraging the formation of new chapters at high schools and universities in the Austin DSA area. The committee will also be responsible for connecting with the National YDSA, as well as chapters outside of the Austin DSA area when relevant. The YDSA Committee shall have two co-chairs, democratically elected by the committee membership, one of whom shall be the YDSA Coordinator. Other officer positions and subcommittees may be created if approved by the membership of the committee without needing amendments to the bylaws herein.

## FURTHER IT BE RESOLVED, that we amend Section 5.13, “YDSA Chapter Coordinator,” to read:

The YDSA Chapter Coordinator shall be a Co-chair of the YDSA Committee and shall be responsible for coordinating activities and campaigns of the Chapter with Young Democratic Socialists of America chapters in and near Central Texas, including without limitations: (a) supporting existing YDSA organizing committees and chapters in their organizing efforts; (b) facilitating tabling and other direct recruitment at university, community college, and high school campuses; and (c) fostering leadership and orderly transitions of leadership in local YDSA groups.
