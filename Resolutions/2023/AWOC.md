# Supporting the creation of local EWOC group - AWOC (Austin Worker Organizing Committee)
Passed: 9/26/2023 - 69 Yes - 0 No - 1 Abstain

**Whereas** 
- EWOC is a collaborative project between national DSA and the UE union.
- DSA voted at the 2023 convention to encourage chapters to start local EWOC groups. Local EWOC groups will be able to meet in-person, connect workers from different workplaces in a shared struggle, and allow strategic experimentation to adapt to local conditions.
- Local EWOC groups are subsidiaries of EWOC, not of local DSA chapters.
- Because of this, EWOC locals will be separate organizations from their respective local DSA chapter.
- EWOC has not yet determined best practices for governance of local EWOC chapters. As one example, it is currently unclear who would count as a local EWOC’s “members,” eligible to vote in a leadership election.
- Austin DSA wants to start organizing workers and building a local group as soon as possible. 
- Creating a local EWOC Group requires applying to national EWOC with a lead organizer and 5 core organizers.

**Resolved** 
- A group of Austin DSA members and local organizers will apply to national EWOC to create a local group, which will be titled, AWOC, “Austin Worker Organizing Committee.”
- Crystal M, who has great experience in EWOC and in labor organizing, and Mike N, who has experience working with EWOC and building out campaign structures, will be listed as the lead organizers.
- Lisa L, Christian P, Don J, and others will be listed as core organizers.
- In lieu of established best practices from national EWOC, a temporary leadership and operating structure is established below to begin building the capacity of this crucial organizing chapter and the capacity of its participants in a timely manner.
- The co-chairs will serve a 1 year term. In September 2024, new leaders will be elected according to the established best practices of the national EWOC at that date.
- If the chapter feels the lead organizers are not performing their duties to satisfaction, Austin DSA’s LC can reach out to DSA’s Labor Committee, who has oversight over EWOC, and ask that one or both lead organizers be replaced.
- Austin DSA will sign onto the letter to national EWOC to create a local AWOC  group in Austin.
- AWOC will communicate to Ausin DSA its relevant upcoming actions and events.
- Austin DSA will support AWOC, encouraging members to volunteer and promoting AWOC actions including in but not limited to at meetings and in web communications.
- Upon creation AWOC will engage in 4 main activities:
    - Accepting cases in the Austin area and assigning them to organizers in Austin. Organizers in Austin will work with the workers who filed the case to most strategically win whatever changes they and their co-workers want to see in their workplace. Organizers will connect workers with other workers who are organizing.
    - Host a monthly training/discussion, where rank-and-file workers organizing in their workplace can learn organizing skills and discuss their situations at work with other workers. 
    - Create communications, including social media posts, videos, articles, and printed materials, promoting AWOC, informing workers how to get help from AWOC, and political education around how to organize workplaces and win concessions from bosses.
    - Strategically map Austin to form new connections between workers across workplaces and sectors. Identify sectors, geographic areas, or parent companies where workers across workplaces can combine forces to bargain as a larger unit. Research creative and unorthodox tactics workers organizing with AWOC can use to win concessions from their bosses.
- This resolution does not request any specific funding for AWOC, as EWOC calls on local groups to perform their own fundraising.. If funds are required at a future date, AWOC will present a separate resolution to Austin DSA. However, AWOC requests, as of the passage of this resolution, access to the following chapter resources: zoom, text and phone bank capacity, social media development, inclusion on the website, calendar and slack. 
- As the creation of local EWOC chapters is a new and exciting new organizing terrain in the DSA, and in the Austin DSA organizing scene particularly, AWOC will keep record of its successes and failures, noting best practices and lessons learned.
