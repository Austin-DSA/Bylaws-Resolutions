# Schools for All Campaign Resolution

Passed: 9/26/2023 - 66 Yes - 0 No - 0 Abstain

## Resolution Text

**WHEREAS,** public schools are a crucial public service and a sector which has long supported working class communities, that socialists should fight to protect and expand, with the goal of creating truly working class institutions,

**WHEREAS,** Austin DSA has previously campaigned for teachers’ wages, labor standards for AISD construction workers, and a slate of pro-worker school board candidates in our Green New Deal for Public Schools campaign,

**WHEREAS,** right-wing movements are attempting to defund public schools and promote private schools, creating a two-tiered education system where only wealthy families can afford a quality education,

**WHEREAS,** the Republican Party in Texas is undermining local democracy and public education with a variety of tactics, including the following:

- The Texas legislature passed HB3, requiring an armed guard on every public school campus, [(1)](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/local/2023/08/03/austin-isd-to-double-police-force-to-comply-with-texas-house-bill-3/70508513007/)
- The Texas Education Agency placed a conservatorship on Houston ISD that escalated to the elected school board being replaced by a state-appointed superintendent, and recently threatened Austin ISD with a similar conservatorship, [(2)](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/projects/timeline/houston-isd-takeover/) [(3)](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/education/article/austin-isd-conservatorship-tea-takeover-hisd-17875573.php)
- Greg Abbot and his allies in the Texas legislature are pushing to pass a school voucher program, which would transfer public funds to private school tuition, benefiting wealthy families, [(4)](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/08/11/texas-house-committee-report-school-vouchers/)
- Right-wing politicians and pundits are spreading transphobic lies in order to incite a backlash against LGBT+ students and teachers. Extremist, pro-censorship candidates have campaigned on this moral panic narrative in Round Rock ISD, Wylie ISD, and more rural districts, to varying degrees of success, [(5)](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/14/texas-round-rock-school-board-races/) [(6)](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/23/texas-schools-bill-sexuality-gender-identity/) [(7)](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2023/06/12/hb-900-texas-book-ban-gov-greg-abbott-sign-banning-sexually-explicit-content-public-school-libraries/70314516007/)

**WHEREAS,** community members who are already disillusioned with the district’s struggling school system may not oppose a state takeover of AISD, unless socialists can present a positive alternative vision for the education system,

**RESOLVED,** Austin DSA will campaign for well-funded community schools that provide students and their families the resources they need, while involving teachers, students, families and community members in the democratic process. This participatory model of education will be held in direct contrast to heavy-handed state takeovers used to implement austerity.

## Workplan and Phases

**Phase One (September 2023 - November 2023):**
Collaborate with Education Austin to do community outreach and mobilization around the Fall 2023 Texas Legislative Special Session. This work will encompass both advocacy against voucher programs and increased armed guards in schools as a result of HB3. The secondary objective of this phase is to lay the groundwork to organize in coalition with Education Austin (EdA); educators, working class families, and students for subsequent campaigns.

**Phase Two (November 2023 - April 2024):**
Pressure AISD board of trustees, Campus Advisory Councils, and/or any other local relevant decision making bodies in regards to community and worker demands. Engagement with the base built in Objective One will serve as the basis for these demands, and may include the following based on previous campaigns:

- Free school lunches and breakfasts;
- Safe routes for students to walk and bike to school;
- Defining the work day as eight hours for school staff; and
- Replacing armed SROs (police officers) with unarmed staff trained for restorative disciplinary practices instead of punitive ones.

The secondary objective of this phase will be to identify and equip organic leaders from within the ongoing coalition, with a specific eye toward leaders from within DSA.

**Phase Three (1-4 Years, as needed):**
Organize against a TEA conservatorship and potential state takeover of AISD. The coalition and organic leaders developed in objectives one and two will be critical to the sustainability of this long-term campaign.

Tactics for all three phases may include:

- Canvassing
- Media Creation
- Town Hall and other public events
- Phonebanks
- Coordination with our Regional DSA Organizer to work with and learn from other chapters
- DSA members applying for and becoming certified substitute teachers within AISD, to support rank and file teachers
- Meeting with elected officials and other decision makers
- Creation and meetings of subcommittees including but not limited to research, power mapping, and events planning

Because of the longevity of this campaign, the Schools for All committee will update the general body at least quarterly for the duration. At the Austin DSA convention in May 2024 the Schools for All committee will propose a resolution to reaffirm and refine, as needed, the objectives, timelines, and resources of the campaign.
