# Llyod Doggett Ceasefire Resolution
Passed: 11/6/2023 - 77-3-2 Yes-No-Abstain
**Whereas,** over [8,000 Palestinian people have already been killed by Israeli airstrikes](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/11/1/know-their-names-palestinians-killed-in-israeli-attacks-on-gaza) and ground incursions into [both the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank]()https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/dozens-killed-arrested-in-overnight-raids-on-west-bank-and-gaza),

**Whereas,** the military attack by Hamas killed approximately 1,400 Israeli civilians,

**Whereas,** the [international community is overwhelmingly calling for a ceasefire](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/bolivia-cuts-ties-with-israel-other-latin-american-countries-recall-envoys) as the bare minimum demand,

**Whereas,** DSA has committed itself to the liberation of all colonized and oppressed people in the world, as shown in previous statements on the Palestinian cause and in our past endorsements of projects organized by groups such as the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights,

**Whereas,** our democratically decided upon 2021 political platform calls to:

>Support self-determination for the Palestinian people and a political solution to the current crisis premised on the guarantee of basic human rights, including an end to the military occupation, an end to discrimination against Palestinians within Israel, and the right of return of refugees, as outlined in the call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.

**Whereas,** national DSA has [called](https://twitter.com/DemSocialists/status/1710857370371559516?s=20) for us to take action against military funding for the state of Israel and has created the [No Money For Massacres](https://actionnetwork.org/events/no-money-for-massacres-solidarity-phone-bank-1101/) campaign to pursue this goal,

**Whereas,** Lloyd Doggett is US Congressional Representative of the 37th district, which covers portions of Austin, and is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus,

**Whereas,** 18 members of the Progressive Caucus members have already signed on to Cori Bush’s Ceasefire Now Resolution. and 22 members have made statements calling for a ceasefire,

**Whereas,** publicly, Lloyd Doggett has responded to constituent emails and phone calls about signing onto the ceasefire with calls “for a halt in the fighting because the killing of civilians continues, yet meaningful relief and safety for civilians has not happened,” which, effectively, is calling for a ceasefire in words without backing one in action,

**Whereas,** Lloyd Doggett is considered to be a target of the pressure campaign that can be moved into supporting the ceasefire resolution, and finally

**Whereas,** Lloyd Doggett has thus far appeared resistant to prior email and phone call campaigns alone, necessitating an escalation of tactics,

**Therefore be it resolved,** that Austin DSA will join in a coalition effort to pressure Representative Doggett to sign on to [Cori Bush’s Ceasefire Now Resolution](https://bush.house.gov/imo/media/doc/bushceasefirenowresolution.pdf). This resolution is twofold in calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel/Palestine, as well as aid to Palestinians.

This coalition will be jointly founded by Austin DSA & Jewish Voice for Peace. It will be open to other organizations who are committed to the specific goals and tactics included in this resolution.

Austin DSA will commit to this coalition work through December 31, 2023. If the goal of this resolution is achieved sooner, the coalition will either dissolve or request a new charter by a vote of the membership or Leadership Committee. If the goal is not achieved by then, the committee may request an extension of the charter by a vote of the membership or Leadership Committee.

This campaign will utilize traditional tactics of an escalating pressure campaign, but because of the urgency of this demand as well as the vast amount of public pressure already being exerted, the sequencing of these tactics will be flexible to meet the opportunities that present themselves.

Those tactics could include: 
- In person meetings with Rep Doggett and/or his staff
- Bird-dogging, or attending public events where the Representative is present, whether those events are in regards to Palestine/ Israel or not, in order to speak for the demand
- Phone banking constituents of TX-37 and asking them to call Rep Doggett’s office
- Sit ins and other protest demonstrations 
- Creation of videos and other social media content targeting Representative Doggett by name
- Power mapping significant donors and supporters to Rep Doggett. Mobilizing those who are supporters to pressure Rep Doggett alongside our coalition. Calling out the opposition publicly in order to neutralize them and shame their influence on the Representative.

This coalition will also serve to educate, agitate, and organize members of the public on the issue of Palestinian liberation. Specifically, Austin DSA will:
- Work alongside Jewish Voice for Peace to meet the goal of equipping Jewish organizers to take on this work successfully by offering organizing trainings and opportunities to both JVP and DSA membership
- Host at least one political education event for participants and interweave political education into the mobilizing components of the campaign
- Recruit attendees to join Austin DSA & JVP

The resources needed for this campaign will include:
- Dialer support from National DSA staff through the No Money for Massacres campaign, with support from the Campaigns Coordinator: $500
- Text banking Austin DSA Action Network contacts for turnout: $500
- Social media content creation by the Communications Committee: $0
- Meeting facilitation and spaces (zoom and in person): $0
- Supplies for protest materials including signs, marshaling and safety: $100
- Facilitation from the Political Education committee: $0
Expected total costs: $1100

Austin DSA will not and can not commit to providing legal funds or bail funds in the event that any participants are arrested or prosecuted in the course of this campaign.
